## Debugging?

What went wrong? Where? How to fix?

<!-- discussion -->

----

## Debugging Questions

* Can we reproduce the problem?
* What were the inputs to the model?
* Which exact model version was used?
* What data was the model trained with?
* What learning code (cleaning, feature extraction, ML algorithm) was the model trained with?
* Where does the data come from? How was it processed and extracted?
* Were other models involved? Which version? Based on which data?
* What parts of the input are responsible for the (wrong) answer? How can we fix the model?

---

# Data Provenance

Historical record of data and its origin

----

## Data Provenance

* Track origin of all data
    - Collected where?
    - Modified by whom, when, why?
    - Extracted from what other data or model or algorithm?
* ML models often based on data drived from many sources through many steps, including other models

----

## Tracking Data

* Document all data sources
* Model dependencies and flows
* Ideally model all data and processing code
* Avoid "visibility debt"
* 
* Advanced: Use infrastructure to automatically capture/infer dependencies and flows (e.g., [Goods](http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45390.pdf) paper)

```

----

## Logging and Audit Traces

* Version everything
* Record every model evaluation with model version
* Append only, backed up

# Fixing Models

----

## Orchestrating Multiple Models

* Try different modeling approaches in parallel
* Pick one, voting, sequencing, metamodel, or responding with worst-case prediction

<!-- colstart -->

```mermaid
graph TD
input --> model1
model1 --> model2
model2 --> model3
model1 --> yes
model2 --> yes
model3 --> yes
model3 --> no
```
<!-- col -->
```mermaid
graph TD
input --> model1
input --> model2
input --> model3
model1 --> vote
model2 --> vote
model3 --> vote
vote --> yes/no
```
<!-- col -->
```mermaid
graph TD
input --> model1
input --> model2
input --> model3
model1 --> metamodel
model2 --> metamodel
model3 --> metamodel
metamodel --> yes/no
```
<!-- colend -->

----

## Chasing Bugs

* Update, clean, add, remove data
* Change modeling parameters
* Add regression tests
* Fixing one problem may lead to others, recognizable only later

----

## Partitioning Contexts

* Separate models for different subpopulations
* Potentially used to address fairness issues
* ML approaches typically partition internally already

```mermaid
graph TD
input --> decision[pick model]
decision --> model1
decision --> model2
decision --> model3
model1 --> yes/no
model2 --> yes/no
model3 --> yes/no
```

----

## Overrides

* Hardcoded heuristics (usually created and maintained by humans) for special cases
* Whitelists, blacklists
* Guardrails
* Potential neverending attempt to fix special cases

```mermaid
graph TD
input --> blacklist
blacklist --> no
blacklist --> model
model --> yes
model --> no
```

## Case Study: Facebook's Feed Curation
<!-- smallish -->

* 62% of interviewees were not aware of curation algorithm
* Surprise and anger when learning about curation

> "Participants were most upset when close friends and
family were not shown in their feeds [...] participants often attributed missing stories to their friendsâ€™ decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm."

* Learning about algorithm did not change satisfaction level
* More active engagement, more feeling of control

----

## "It's just the algorithm/model"

* Specifications can be discussed, somebody made a decision
* ML models are trained, some wrong results are to be expected 
* Assigning blame: Person making decisions, algorithm/specification, opaque model? Path to appeal?

----
## Appealing ML Decisions

* See requirements lecture: Planning for mistakes
* Allow way to override decisions or accept mistakes?
    - Automation degree vs. cost for human intervention (support)
* Review model for quality and fairness
* How to fix? One-off? Fix model?

## Explainability in AI

* Explain how the model made a decision
    - Rules, cutoffs, reasoning?
    - What are the relevant factors? 
    - Why those rules/cutoffs?
* Challenging in symbolic AI with complicated rules
* Challenging with ML because models too complex and based on data
    - Can we understand the rules?
    - Can we understand why these rules?

----

## Explaining Black-Box Models

* Learn simpler model by sampling from more complex one
    - e.g., decision tree learned from DNN outputs
* Roughly: Sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters

Notes: It is based on Shapley values, a technique used in game theory to determine how much each player in a collaborative game has contributed to its success. Works for any tree-based models.

## "Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead"

<!-- smallish -->

Hypotheses:
* It is a myth that there is necessarily a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability (when having meaningful features)
* Explainable ML methods provide explanations that are not faithful to what the original model computes
* Explanations often do not make sense, or do not provide enough detail to understand what the black box is doing
* Black box models are often not compatible with situations where information outside the database needs to be combined with a risk assessment
*  Black box models with explanations can lead to an overly complicated decision pathway that is ripe for human error

* Algorithmic transparency can impact users and usability
* Explainability is an open challenge, interpretable models vs post-hoc extracted explanations
