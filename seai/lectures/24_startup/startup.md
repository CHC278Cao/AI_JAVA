## Discussion Questions

* What's the hypothesis behind your startup?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* i.e., What does it mean for it to succeed?
* What are potential risks that might cause the hypothesis to fail?
Any ML related risks?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Data collection? Telemetry? Model quality? Security or privacy
      issues?  Safety? Ethical or legal? 
* What are ways to test your hypothesis and address these specific risks? What
MVPs can you use to do so?

## Case Study: Transcription services

![](transcription.png)

* Take audio or video files and produce text
    - Used by academics to analyze interview text
    - Podcast show notes, subtitles for videos
* State of the art: Manual transcription, often mechanical turk (1.5 $/min)

## The startup idea

PhD research on domain-specific speech recognition, that can detect technical jargon

DNN trained on public PBS interviews + transfer learning on smaller manually annotated domain-specific corpus

Research has shown amazing accuracy for talks in medicine, poverty and inequality research, and talks at Ruby programming conferences; published at top conferences

Idea: Let's commercialize the software and sell to academics and conference organizers

# Summary

* Startup planning as hypothesis building & testing
  * Hypothesis: What does it mean for your startup to succeed?
  * What are (ML-related) risks to a successful startup?
  * What MVPs can you build to test your hypothesis & address the risks?
