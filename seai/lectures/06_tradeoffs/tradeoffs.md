----
## Decision Tree Learning

![decision-tree-fraud](credit-card-fraud.png)

* Tasks: Classification & regression
* Non-leaf nodes: Conditional on input variables (features)
* Leaf nodes: Class labels or continuous output values
* Easy to interpret; can capture non-linearity; can do well with
  little data
* Low accuracy (high risk of overfitting); possibly very large tree size

----
## Neural Network

![neural-network](neural-network.png)

* Tasks: Classification & regression
* Advantages: ??
* Disadvantages: ??

----
## Neural Network

![neural-network](neural-network.png)

* Tasks: Classification & regression
* High accuracy; can capture a wide range of problems (linear & non-linear)
* Difficult to interpret; high training costs (time & amount of
  data required, hyperparameter tuning)

----
## k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

![knn](knn.png)

* Tasks: Classification & regression
* Infer the class/property of an object based on that of _k_ nearest neighbors
* **Lazy learning**: Generalization is delayed until
  the inference takes place 
* Advantages: ??
* Disadvantages: ??

----
## k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

![knn](knn.png)

* Tasks: Classification & regression
* Infer the class/property of an object based on that of _k_ nearest neighbors
* **Lazy learning**: Generalization is delayed until
  the inference takes place 
* Easy to interpret; no training required (due to lazy learning); incremental (can continuously add new data) 
* Potentially slow inference (again, due to lazy learning); high data storage
  requirement (must store training instances)

  individual trees

# Tradeoff Analysis

## Trade-offs: Cost vs Accuracy

_"We evaluated some of the new methods offline but the additional
accuracy gains that we measured did not seem to justify the
engineering effort needed to bring them into a production
environment.‚Äù_

----
## Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)

![moo](moo.png)

* Determine optimal solutions given multiple, possibly
  **conflicting** objectives
* **Dominated** solution: A solution that is inferior to
  others in every way 
* **Pareto frontier**: A set of non-dominated solutions 

----
## Example: Sales Forecast

![ads](outdoor-advertising.jpg)

* For problems with a linear relationship between input & output variables:
  * Linear regression: Superior in terms of accuracy, interpretability, cost 
  * Other methods are dominated (inferior) solutions

----
## ML Method Selection as MOO

1. Identify a set of constraints
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Start with problem & project constraints
	* From them, derive design constraints on ML components
2. Eliminate ML methods that do not satisfy the constraints
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Evaluate remaining methods against each attribute
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Measure everything that can be measured! (e.g., training cost,
    accuracy, inference time...)
4. Eliminate dominated methods to find the Pareto frontier 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. Consider priorities among attributes to select an optimal method
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Which attribute(s) do I care the most about?

----
## Example: Object Detection

![pedestrian-detection](pedestrian-detection.png)

* Constraints: ML task (classification), inference time (fast,
 real-time), model size (moderate, for on-vehicle storage)
* Invalid solutions: ??
* Priority among attributes: ??

----
## Example: Object Detection

![pedestrian-detection](pedestrian-detection.png)

* Constraints: ML task (classification), inference time (fast,
 real-time), model size (moderate, for on-vehicle storage)
* Invalid solutions: Linear regression, k-NN
* Priority among attributes: What if accuracy > interpretability = cost?

----
## Exercise: Medical Diagnosis

![medical-diagnosis](medical-diagnosis.jpg)

* Constraints: Type of ML task? Accuracy?
Interpretability?  
* Which ML methods satisfy the constraints?
* Which methods are Pareto optimal?
* Which method would you choose under what priority?
